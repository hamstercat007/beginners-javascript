# Beginners JavaScript Workshop

## What is this?  AN INTRODUCTION TO FORKING!!!

This is an introductory workshop to JavaScript. You'll be learning the fundamentals of JavaScript, and completing some mini-challenges along the way.

## Why JavaScript?

If you want to learn to code, JavaScript is a great first language. As the official language of the web, you can build amazing websites and applications with JavaScript alongside HTML and CSS. It's easy to use, and has immediate payoff. Once you learn JavaScript, you'll find it easier to learn other programming languages which share common concepts.

## Workshop Structure

This workshop is divided into a number of steps. In each step, you will be introduced to a new programming concept, be shown some examples, and be given a challenge to complete. At the end of each step, you should find a link to continue onto the next step.

## Where to Run Your Code

As you write code, you'll want to be able to see what it does. For this, you need to "run it" somewhere. You can do this in a number of ways, but to keep things simple today, we are going to use a tool called [Repl.it](https://repl.it/). Create an account, and start a new project on the site. Make sure to select JavaScript as your language of choice.
